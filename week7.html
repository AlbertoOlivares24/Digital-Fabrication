    </br>
</br>
</br>
</br>


<p>Week 7 was pretty confusing at first</p>
<p>The objective was to learn how to use a CNC mill and try out molding and casting</p>
<p>First things first, you gotta make a design</p>
<p>For me, a design I thought would be cool were swords, so start off by making one:</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/sword_1.PNG" width = 35% height = 40% >
<p>Measurements are included in the picture, but once you have one sword, guess what? You can copy paste the next one and move it into place</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/sword_2.PNG" width = 35% height = 40% >
<p>But you know its boring if you just have the same design on both sides, so I recommend seeing if you can give each sword some uniqueness</p>
<p>For me, the way to do that was to alter the handles</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/sword_handle1.PNG" width = 40% height = 40% >
<img src = "./assets/img/sword_handle2.PNG" width = 40% height = 40% >
<p>As you can see, each of the swords has a unique handle giving a feeling of each being different</p>
<p>Next, lets just extrude the swords a bit, doesnt have to be too much, maybe 1 or 2 cm for me</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/Sword_3.PNG" width = 35% height = 40% >
<p>Now, its time to get to work</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/cnc.gif" width = 60% height = 80% >
<p>First things first you gotta get some wax to put in the shopbot</p>
<p>The shopbot will then cut the design you created into the wax</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/wax_cut.png" width = 45% height = 40% >
<p>This is what my wax cut ended up looking like</p>
<p>Next thing you gotta do is make your solution with one half part A solution and the other half part B</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/solution.png" width = 40% height = 40% >
<p>This solution will eventually become a solid instead of a liquid and have a consistency similar to plastic? puddy? I dont know.</p>
<p>Only problem? I used the wrong kind of solution, and mixed clear part A with non-clear part B (make sure you dont do that)</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/cleaning.png" width = 50% height = 60% >
<p>The result was that I had to clean out the solution from my wax mold so that I could try again, im sure you can see how happy I was about that</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/wax_after.png" width = 40% height = 40% >
<p>After picking at the wax with a knife and cleaning it the best I could this was the result, and it was time to make another solution</p>
<p>I made the solution again, poured it in and waited a day aaaand:</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/silicone.png" width = 45% height = 50% >
<p>It honestly came out better than I thought considering my previoius mistake</p>
<p>But, this is only my mold, I havent cast anything yet, and I thought what better material to cast swords out of other than Bismuth?</p>
<p>So, I heated up a pot of bismuth!</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/bismuth.png" width = 45% height = 50% >
<p>As soon as that was done I scooped it up, and poured it into my mold</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/mold_bismuth.png" width = 45% height = 50% >
<p>When that is done hardening you should get this:</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/finished_sword.png" width = 45% height = 50% >
<p>Additionally, if you like you can carefully take a chisel and a hammer and see about taking away any excess</p>
<p>I strongly recommend not doing this if you're like me and have really shaky hands because I uhhh....</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/finished_sword2.png" width = 45% height = 50% >
<p>I cracked it. I cracked the sword not only once, not twice, but three whole times.</p>
<p>That aside, this week was a lot of fun, and I hope I can work with molds again in the future!</p>
