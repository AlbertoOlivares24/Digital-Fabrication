<p>Week 8 started off a bit rough, I was unsure about what I wanted to do and eventually decided it would be best to work on something simple but cool so I could focus on my final</p>
<p>I decided to make a LAN server which controlled an led light on my breadboard</p>
<p>However, this simple project quickly became something that took up a bit too much of my time</p>

<p>Above is the SimpleWifi example code thats featured on Arduino</p>
<p>I didnt think this would give me any issues, considering its example code and such</p>
<p>However, this would cause me headache for the next 2 hours</p>
<p>The specific issue was a client disconnect whenever I tried to click a button to turn on or off the LED</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/debug.PNG" width = 50% height = 55% >
<p>Google search after google search I wasnt finding any answers, the ESP32 board is extremely picky and can be complicated to use</p>
<p>So, so you can avoid frustration here is a list of things that didnt fix this issue for me:</p>
<p>1. Using a different ESP32</p>
<p>2. Checking my wiring (will be shown later)</p>
<p>3. Waiting until the wifi is connected before starting server</p>
<p>4. Using a hotspot</p>
<p>5. Ressetting ESP32 before, during, and after connection</p>
<p>6. Changing wires</p>
<p>7. Changing LED's</p>
<p>8. Changing resistor type</p>
<p>9. Changing breadboard's</p>
<p>Even searching up the error on google came up with no results</p>
<p>I did these in order, and when I reached the point of changing the breadboard I thought that it was impossible for it to be anything else</p>
<p>I was wrong</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/lights.png" width = 50% height = 50% >
<p>This was my wiring, with the brand new breadboard I was using</p>
<p>In this process I decided to change the code I was using</p>

<p>Notice how there's no resistor? Thats right, no matter the resistor I had, for some reason using it did not allow the light to come out, even at 5V</p>
<p>Imagine how happy I was to have finally fixed my issue, with of course the frustration of the problem being so miniscule</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/lights_2.png" width = 50% height = 50%>
<p>Oh by the way, I ended up adding another light onto the breadboard, Il explain why now</p>
<p>The new website featured a better design, one that let me control two different lights individually</p>
<p>As a result, I decided why not have two lights instead of one?</p>
<video width="50%" height="60%" autoplay muted>
    <source src="assets/img/lights_working.mov" type="video/mp4"> </video>
<p>So, this was this weeks project, definitely gave me a lot of frustration but in the end it was totally worth it</p>
<p>Getting this done now lets me continue working on my final project which I couldnt be more excited to show</p>
<p>So yeah thats all, big thank you again to randomnerdtutorials for the amazing guide which helped make this possible</p>
