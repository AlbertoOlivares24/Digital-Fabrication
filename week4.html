        </br>
    </br>
</br>
</br>
<p>For my 3D printing assignment I first had to make a quick 10 minute print, I chose to make a charger </p>
<p>The wall sockets in Europe are different from American ones, so I always had to pack these</p>
<img src = "assets/img/Charger_Fusion.PNG" height = 25% width = 25%>
<p>Me and my family would always fight for who got to use them first so it was pretty cool to model and make a small version without purpose</p>
<img src = "assets/img/Charger_printed" height = 25% width = 25%>
<p>It was a pretty small print but I was happy with how it turned out. I plan to keep it as a memento of my time at harvard and my trips to Europe</p>
<p>However, memories can only get me so far and it was time to look toward the future, my upcoming final project</p>
<p>I decided it would be a good idea to model out a first draft of the wheel that will be used to scoop up dirt in my final project</p>
<img src = "assets/img/final_project_assist.PNG" height = 45% width = 35%>
<p>You start off my creating a circle with a circle, create construction lines thorugh the middle to help guide and then set the length you want the collector to be</p>
<p>Once that done you can extrude the piece, for me I chose to extrude it by 20mm</p>
<img src = "assets/img/final_project_assist2.PNG" height = 25% width = 25%>
<p>When its extruded draw a new sketch on the face labelled, this part will be hollowed out in order to collect dirt</p>
<img src = "assets/img/final_project_assist_3.PNG" height = 25% width = 25%>
<p>Finally, create a square and extrude it by a negative value in order to hollow out the piece I again used 20 mm</p>
<img src = "assets/img/final_project_wheel_draft.PNG" height = 25% width = 25%>
<p>The first draft of this wasnt very succesful and I had to try and create it again</p>
<img src = "assets/img/final_project_wheel_draft2.PNG" height = 25% width = 25%>
<p>What I had to change was when I decided to mirror the collector, if you do it once the wheel is extruded you can run into some issues</p>
<p>The second draft was a lot better, but while I was printing I realized a couple flaws, for starters I had to find a way to make the inside of the wheel hollow to hold the dirt</p>
<p>The second problem was that there were some holes in the print that shouldnt have been there, a problem with my poor modeling in fusion360 for sure</p>
<img src = "assets/img/3d_printer_working.gif" height 40% width = 40%>
<p>3D Printer time lapses are some of the most satisfying things to watch</p>
<img src = "assets/img/Final_project_wheel_printed" height = 25% width = 25%>
<p>Aditionally, I was also assigned to take a photogrammetry to make a 3D scan, I obviously decided to do my face</p>
<img src = "assets/img/me_rotating.gif" height = 60% width = 45%>
<p>Believe it or not this scan is my 5th one, I couldnt get much better since I was too busy laughing at my friend waddling around me with his phone camera</p>
<p>Either way, now that im a bit more experienced with 3D printing I do plan on working on this again whenever I get the chance</p>
<p>Will update when I can</p>
