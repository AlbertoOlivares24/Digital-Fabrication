<p>For my 3D printing assignment I first had to make a quick 10 minute print, I chose to make an chargers</p>
<p>I remember always needing chargers like these every time I went to Europe or else I wouldnt be able to charge anything</p>
<img src = "assets/img/Charger_Fusion.PNG" height = 50% width = 50%>
<p>Me and my family would always fight for who got to use them first so it was pretty cool to model and make a small version without purpose</p>
<img src = "assets/img/Charger_printed" height = 50% width = 50%>
<p>It was a pretty small print but I was happy with how it turned out. I plan to keep it as a memento of my time at harvard and my trips to Europe</p>
<p>However, memories can only get me so far and it was time to look toward the future, my upcoming final project</p>
<p>I decided it would be a good idea to model out the wheel that will scoop up the dirt</p>
<img src = "assets/img/final_project_wheel_draft.PNG" height = 50% width = 50%>
<p>The first draft of this wasnt very succesful as I had a lot of trouble making multiple of the notches that collect the dirt</p>
<img src = "assets/img/final_project_wheel_draft2.PNG" height = 50% width = 50%>
<p>The second draft was a lot better, but while I was printing I realized a couple flaws, for starters I had to find a way to make the inside of the wheel hollow to hold the dirt</p>
<p>The second problem was that there were some holes in the print that shouldnt have been there, a problem with my poor modeling in fusion360 for sure</p>
<img src = "assets/img/Final_project_wheel_printed" height = 50% width = 50%>
<p>Now that im a bit more experienced with 3D printing I do plan on working on this again whenever I get the chance</p>
<p>Will update when I can</p>
