<p>Week 9 was a challenging one, stepper motors definitely have a high learning curve that I want to keep practicing</p>
<p>To start off, I was having issues with some of the wiring</p>
<p>As a reminder: Always make sure you're checking your wiring for any issues (especially when the issue is that you dont have power connected)</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/step1.jpg" width = 40% height = 40% >
<p>Here is a picture of my wiring and how it was connected to my motor</p>
<p>Aside from, yknow, not having my power plugged in there was another mistake id like to warn you of if you try to replicate this</p>
<p>Make sure you solder carefully, to make the process easier strip the wires of the motor and solder on male to male wire types</p>
<p>When you do that, make sure you use the heat press to make sure nothing sticks out and you should be good</p>
<p>Either way, for this weeks project I decided to revisit one of my old projects: my elevator from kinetic structures</p>
<p>I thought this was a good project to revisit as stepper motors allow me to have more control over the elevator itself</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/step2.jpg" width = 40% height = 40% >
<p>Issue was, the motor was really really heavy. As a result, I had to make a simple way to balance out the structure</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/step3.jpg" width = 35% height = 40% >
<p>Now just do that for both sides, and there you go! The elevator shaft should stand on its own</p>
<pre style = 'background-color:white;color:black'>
    #include <Stepper.h>

        const int stepsPerRevolution = 200; 
        
        
        Stepper myStepper(stepsPerRevolution, 12, 13);
        
        void setup() {
        myStepper.setSpeed(100);
        Serial.begin(9600);
        }
        
        void loop() {
        myStepper.step(-2000);
        delay(2000);
        
        myStepper.step(2000);
        delay(2000);
        }
</pre>
<p>My code honestly wasnt anything crazy, I really only need the elevator to know when to stop and start</p>
<p>With a little bit of trial and error you can find that out pretty easily, and adjust accordingly</p>
<img src = "./assets/img/step_working_real.gif   " width = 50% height = 50%>
<p>Sadly though, my elevator years in service were starting to catch up to it, and I was having some issues making it stable</p>
<p>I tried my best to fix it as best I could but couldnt really make much of a difference from home, so I decided to leave this week and focus on my newest venture, my final project</p>
